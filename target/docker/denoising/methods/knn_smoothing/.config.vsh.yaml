    summary: "Iterative kNN-smoothing denoises scRNA-seq data by iteratively increasing\
      \ the size of neighbourhoods for smoothing until a maximum k value is reached."
    description: "Iterative kNN-smoothing is a method to repair or denoise noisy scRNA-seq\
      \ expression matrices. Given a scRNA-seq expression matrix, KNN-smoothing first\
      \ applies initial normalisation and smoothing. Then, a chosen number of principal\
      \ components is used to calculate Euclidean distances between cells. Minimally\
      \ sized neighbourhoods are initially determined from these Euclidean distances,\
      \ and expression profiles are shared between neighbouring cells. Then, the resultant\
      \ smoothed matrix is used as input to the next step of smoothing, where the\
      \ size (k) of the considered neighbourhoods is increased, leading to greater\
      \ smoothing. This process continues until a chosen maximum k value has been\
      \ reached, at which point the iteratively smoothed object is then optionally\
      \ scaled to yield a final result."
