    summary: "A linear method that finds orthogonal directions to compute the two-dimensional embedding, capturing maximum variance from logCPM expression matrix with/without selecting 1000 HVGs."
    description: |
      'Principal Component Analysis is a linear method that finds orthogonal
      directions in the data that capture the most variance. The first two
      principal components are chosen as the two-dimensional embedding. We select
      only the first two principal components as the two-dimensional embedding. PCA
      is calculated on the logCPM expression matrix with and without selecting 1000
      HVGs.'
