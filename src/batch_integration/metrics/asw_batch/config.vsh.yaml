        summary: Average silhouette of batches per label
        description: |
          "A batch correction metric that computes the silhouette score over all batch labels per cell type. Here, 0 indicates that batches are well mixed and any deviation from 0 indicates there remains a separation between batch labels. This is rescaled to a score between 0 and 1 by taking."
