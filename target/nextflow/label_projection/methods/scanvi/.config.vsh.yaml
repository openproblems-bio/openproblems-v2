    summary: "ScANVI predicts cell type labels for unlabelled test data by leveraging\
      \ cell type labels, modelling uncertainty and using deep neural networks with\
      \ stochastic optimization."
    description: "\"single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference is a\nsemi-supervised\
      \ variant of the scVI(Lopez et al. 2018) algorithm. Like scVI,\nscANVI uses\
      \ deep neural networks and stochastic optimization to model\nuncertainty caused\
      \ by technical noise and bias in single - cell\ntranscriptomics measurements.\
      \ However, scANVI also leverages cell type labels\nin the generative modelling.\
      \ In this approach, scANVI is used to predict the\ncell type labels of the unlabelled\
      \ test data.\"\n"
