    description : |
      scANVI (single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference; Python class SCANVI) is a semi-supervised model for single-cell transcriptomics data. In a sense, it can be seen as a scVI extension that can leverage the cell type knowledge for a subset of the cells present in the data sets to infer the states of the rest of the cells.
