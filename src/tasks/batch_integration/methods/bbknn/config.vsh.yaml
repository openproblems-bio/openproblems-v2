      "BBKNN or batch balanced k nearest neighbours graph is built for each cell by
      identifying its k nearest neighbours within each defined batch separately,
      creating independent neighbour sets for each cell in each batch. These sets
      are then combined and processed with the UMAP algorithm for visualisation."
