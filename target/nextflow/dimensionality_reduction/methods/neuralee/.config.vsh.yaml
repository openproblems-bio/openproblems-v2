      non-linear method that preserves pairwise distances between data points.\nNeuralEE\
      \ uses a neural network to optimize an objective function that\nmeasures the\
      \ difference between pairwise distances in the original\nhigh-dimensional space\

      \ from the package authors of 500 HVGs selected from a\nlogged expression matrix\
