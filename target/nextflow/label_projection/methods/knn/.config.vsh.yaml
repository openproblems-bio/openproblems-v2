    description: "'Using the \"k-nearest neighbours\" approach, which is a\npopular\
      \ machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks.\nThe assumption\
      \ underlying KNN in this context is that cells with similar gene\nexpression\

      \ this method computes the $k$ labelled cells (in this case, 5) with the\nsmallest\
