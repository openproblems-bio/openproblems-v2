description: |
  Match modalities is the task of combining multiple datasets
  that have been generated from the same set of samples. This task is
  important for integrating datasets generated from different modalities
  (e.g. RNA and ATAC) or from different technologies (e.g. 10x and
  SmartSeq). The goal of this task is to evaluate methods for integrating
  multimodal datasets.
