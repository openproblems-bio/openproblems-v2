summary: Learning of an embedded space that leverages the information of multiple modalities (e.g. for improved cell type annotation).
description: |
  The functioning of organs, tissues, and whole organisms is determined by the interplay of cells. 
  Cells are characterised into broad types, which in turn can take on different states. Here, a cell 
  state is made up of the sum of all processes that are occurring within the cell. We can gain insight 
  into the state of a cell by different types of measurements: e.g., RNA expression, protein abundance, 
  or chromatin conformation. Combining this information to describe cellular heterogeneity requires the 
  formation of joint embeddings generated from this multimodal data. These embeddings must account for 
  and remove possible batch effects between different measurement batches. The reward for methods that 
  can achieve this is great: a highly resolved description of the underlying biological state of a cell 
  that determines its function, how it interacts with other cells, and thus the cellâ€™s role in the f
  unctioning of the whole tissue.
