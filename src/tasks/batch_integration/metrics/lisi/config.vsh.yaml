        summary: Local inverse Simpson's Index
        description: |
          "Local Inverse Simpsonâ€™s Index metrics adapted from Korsunsky et al. 2019 to run on all full feature, embedding and kNN integration outputs via shortest path-based distance computation on single-cell kNN graphs. The metric assesses whether clusters of cells in a single-cell RNA-seq dataset are well-mixed across a categorical batch (iLISI) or cell type (cLISI) variable. The original LISI score ranges from 0 to the number of categories, with the latter indicating good cell mixing. This is rescaled to a score between 0 and 1."
