    summary: "Bayesian modeling of spatial molecular profiling data via Gaussian process"
    description: |
      BOOST-GP a novel Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze spatial transcriptomics data, 
      with several unique characteristics. It models the zero-inflated and over-dispersed 
      counts by deploying a zero-inflated negative binomial model that greatly increases 
      model stability and robustness. Besides, the Bayesian inference framework allows us 
      to borrow strength in parameter estimation in a de novo fashion. As a result, 
      the proposed model shows competitive performances in accuracy and robustness 
      over existing methods in both simulation studies and two real data applications.
