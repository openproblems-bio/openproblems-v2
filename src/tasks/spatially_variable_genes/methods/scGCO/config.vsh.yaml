    summary: "Identification of spatially variable genes with graph cuts."
    description: |
      Single-cell gene expression data with positional information is critical to dissect 
      mechanisms and architectures of multicellular organisms, but the potential is limited 
      by the scalability of current data analysis strategies. Here, we present scGCO, 
      a method based on fast optimization of hidden Markov Random Fields with graph cuts 
      to identify spatially variable genes. Comparing to existing methods, scGCO delivers 
      a superior performance with lower false positive rate and improved specificity, 
      while demonstrates a more robust performance in the presence of noises. 
      Critically, scGCO scales near linearly with inputs and demonstrates orders of 
      magnitude better running time and memory requirement than existing methods, 
      and could represent a valuable solution when spatial transcriptomics data grows 
      into millions of data points and beyond..
