        description: The cell type that initiates the communication signal. This serves as the ground-truth cell-cell communication (CCC) information. This vector contains one value per CCC interaction.
        required: true
      - type: object
        name: ccc_target
        description: The cell type which is intended to receive the communicational signal. This vector needs to be of the same length as `ccc_source`.

      - type: object
        name: ccc_ligand
        description: The gene of the signalling molecule released by the source cell. This vector needs to be of the same length as `ccc_source`.

      - type: object
        name: ccc_receptor
        description: The gene of the protein on the surface of the target cell that the ligand specifically binds to. This vector needs to be of the same length as `ccc_source`.
