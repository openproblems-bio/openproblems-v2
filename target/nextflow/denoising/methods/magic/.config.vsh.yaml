    summary: "MAGIC imputes and denoises scRNA-seq data using Euclidean distances\
      \ and a Gaussian kernel to calculate the affinity matrix, followed by a Markov\
      \ process and multiplication with the normalised data to obtain imputed values."
    description: "MAGIC (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells) is a method\
      \ for imputation and denoising of noisy or dropout-prone single cell RNA-sequencing\
      \ data. Given a normalised scRNA-seq expression matrix, it first calculates\
      \ Euclidean distances between each pair of cells in the dataset, which is then\
      \ augmented using a Gaussian kernel (function) and row-normalised to give a\
      \ normalised affinity matrix. A t-step markov process is then calculated, by\
      \ powering this affinity matrix t times. Finally, the powered affinity matrix\
      \ is right-multiplied by the normalised data, causing the final imputed values\
      \ to take the value of a per-gene average weighted by the affinities of cells.\
      \ The resultant imputed matrix is then rescaled, to more closely match the magnitude\
      \ of measurements in the normalised (input) matrix."
