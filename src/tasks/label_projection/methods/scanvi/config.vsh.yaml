    summary: "ScANVI predicts cell type labels for unlabelled test data by leveraging cell type labels, modelling uncertainty and using deep neural networks with stochastic optimization."
    description: |
      single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference is a
      semi-supervised variant of the scVI(Lopez et al. 2018) algorithm. Like scVI,
      scANVI uses deep neural networks and stochastic optimization to model
      uncertainty caused by technical noise and bias in single - cell
      transcriptomics measurements. However, scANVI also leverages cell type labels
      in the generative modelling. In this approach, scANVI is used to predict the
      cell type labels of the unlabelled test data.
