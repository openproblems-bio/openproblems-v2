        summary: "The comparison of explained variance by batch before and after integration."
        description: |
          "This compares the explained variance by batch before and after integration. It
          returns a score between 0 and 1 (scaled=True) with 0 if the variance
          contribution hasnâ€™t changed. The larger the score, the more different the
          variance contributions are before and after integration."
