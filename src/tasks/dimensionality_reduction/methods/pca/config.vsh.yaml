    summary: A linear method that finds orthogonal directions to compute the two-dimensional embedding.
    description: |
      Principal Component Analysis is a linear method that finds orthogonal
      directions in the data that capture the most variance. The first two
      principal components are chosen as the two-dimensional embedding. We select
      only the first two principal components as the two-dimensional embedding. PCA
      is calculated on the logCPM expression matrix with and without selecting 1000
      HVGs.
