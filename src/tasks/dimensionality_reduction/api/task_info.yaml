summary: Reduction of high-dimensional datasets to 2D for visualization & interpretation

motivation: |
  Dimensionality reduction is one of the key challenges in single-cell data representation.
  Routine single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments measure cells in roughly
  20,000-30,000 dimensions (i.e., features - mostly gene transcripts but also other functional
  elements encoded in mRNA such as lncRNAs). Since its inception, scRNA-seq experiments have
  been growing in terms of the number of cells measured. Originally, cutting-edge SmartSeq
  experiments would yield a few hundred cells, at best. Now, it is not uncommon to see
  experiments that yield over [100,000 cells](<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0590-4>)
  or even [> 1 million cells](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba7721).
description: |
  Each *feature* in a dataset functions as a single dimension. While each of the ~30,000
  dimensions measured in each cell contribute to an underlying data structure, the overall
  structure of the data is challenging to display in few dimensions due to data sparsity
  and the [*"curse of dimensionality"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)
  (distances in high dimensional data don't distinguish data points well). Thus, we need to find
  a way to [dimensionally reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)
  the data for visualization and interpretation.
