    summary: Linked Inference of Genomic Experimental Relationships
    description: |
      LIGER or linked inference of genomic experimental relationships uses iNMF 
      deriving and implementing a novel coordinate descent algorithm to efficiently 
      do the factorization. Joint clustering is performed and factor loadings are 
      normalised.
