summary: "Predicting which profiles from one modality resembles a profile from another."
description: |
  "While joint profiling of two modalities in the same single cell is now possible, 
  most single-cell datasets that exist measure only a single modality. These modalities 
  complement each other in their description of cellular state. Yet, it is challenging 
  to analyse uni-modal datasets together when they do not share observations (cells) or 
  a common feature space (genes, proteins, or open chromatin peaks). If we could map 
  observations to one another across modalities, it would be possible to treat separately 
  profiled datasets in the same manner as new multi-modal sequencing data. Mapping these 
  modalities to one another opens up the vast amount of uni-modal single-cell datasets 
  generated in the past years to multi-modal data analysis methods."
