    summary: "Seurat reference mapping predicts cell types for unlabelled cells using PCA distances, labelled anchors, and transfer anchors from Seurat, with SCTransform normalization."
    description: |
      "Seurat reference mapping is a cell type label transfer method provided by the
      Seurat package. Gene expression counts are first normalised by SCTransform
      before computing PCA. Then it finds mutual nearest neighbours, known as
      transfer anchors, between the labelled and unlabelled part of the data in PCA
      space, and computes each cellâ€™s distance to each of the anchor pairs.
      Finally, it uses the labelled anchors to predict cell types for unlabelled
      cells based on these distances."
